# recent-work
This is a repo of work for programs I have recently completed, as well as data required for running them. A description of the contents is as follows.

jazz_tune_reviewer.ipynb
Description: Jazz musicians are expected to know and, ideally, have memorized a set of standard tunes. As a jazz guitarist, I have maintained my knowledge of such tunes by reviewing several per day from an alphabetical list. Reviewing them alphabetically has become stale, though, so I decided to create this program to randomly choose songs to review each day. It maintains a list of tunes to review and tunes reviewed, moving them from the former list to the latter list each time the program is run. To run it, you will have to update the folder where you are storing jazz_tune_complete_list.xlsx. You can toggle the number of tunes to review for the day by updating the num_tunes variable.
Inputs: jazz_tune_complete_list.xlsx.
